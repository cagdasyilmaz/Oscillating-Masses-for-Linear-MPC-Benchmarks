# Oscillating-Masses-for-Linear-MPC-Benchmarks

This reports show the derivation of the linear mass spring system for linear MPC benchmark. This problem is pretty useful for large scale MPC problems. Number of oscillating masses can be readily increased in order to increase the dynamic equations in the systems.
