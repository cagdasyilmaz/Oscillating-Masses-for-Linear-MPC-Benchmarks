# Oscillating-Masses-for-Linear-MPC-Benchmarks

This reports shows the derivation of the linear mass spring system for linear MPC benchmarks. This problem is pretty useful for large scale MPC problems. Number of oscillating masses can be readily increased in order to increase the dynamic equations in the systems. 

The linear spring masses system is applied dozen of academic studies. Position of the mass and applied input are restricted to solve constrained optimization problem. The results in the articles show that some of the solver can be applied to embedded systems to be able to solve fast on-line optimization problems in real-time systems.
